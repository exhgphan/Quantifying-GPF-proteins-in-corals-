#We want to blast GFP against P.Rus geneome. This file contains the commands 
#Step 1: Index files from DNA sequences for BLAST

makeblastdb -in P.Rus_genome.faa -dbtype prot -input_type fasta

#Step 2: BLAST to find matching regions... '-query' is the gene were seaching for in the genome which is represented as the '-subject' 

blastp -query gfp_protein.faa -subject P.Rus_genome.faa -out P.rus_vs_gfp.results.txt -evalue 1e-4 -outfmt 6

#Step 3: Create jupyter notebook to create pandas dataframe,

import pandas as pd

#Step 4: example code to isolate subject column to count number of GFP homolog gene copies

#Step 5:Count hits: Idenitfy the unique subjects as a list and then quanitfy
